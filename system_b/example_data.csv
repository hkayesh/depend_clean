The nurses and Dr was so attentive to providing the best care for me during my stay. I took a turn as surgery and at one point they were 3 doctors there attending to me. I am great full
I encountered nothing but kind and competent staff during treatment
"1 extremely likely! | The staff were extremely friendly, they didnt make you feel like a pest or an inconvenience even when they were stressed and rushed off their feet. They were very articulate with everything, looked into everything and made sure they ruled out any possibilities. I felt well looked after and comfortable. Best hospital Ive ever been in!"

"I only stayed for one night, nurses were lovely kind and helpful, but very busy, maybe need more staff on at night."
When arrived on ward it was 1 hour before I saw anybody ie nurse
Please dont ask anymore questions at the moment i am in agony
Toilet wasnt clean
The nurses at night was brill but one Jamaican nurse was not very nice
Patient care just isnt what it should be. I had major surgery but wasnt checked on often enough. My catheter bag overfilled and flowed back inside me causing unbearable pain on top of the pain I was already suffering. However my strong painkillers were stopped as they wanted to discharge me and could not discharge me with morphine. I was told on my day of discharge to finish my lunch and make my way to the discharge lounge as they needed my bed even tho I could barely move. I was then told I would receive a visit from the district nurses when I was home only to be then told that the referral hadnt actuall
Excellent staff from the surgical team to the ward nurses
"Great staff , excellent facilities - if only the rehab wards were to the same standard"
"Each and every member of staff treated me with a degree of care which made me feel special, to the extent which I was sad when the shifts changed and I didnt see those carers again (however the following staff were always equally lovely). I had a private side room and as a patient under the age of 18, my mum was allowed to stay with me which, I believe, made my recovery much less stressful and also a lot quicker as I was discharged in just 5 days following major spinal correction surgery. Could not thank everybody enough for making those days as good as they could be."
Everyone was so helpful and attentive
